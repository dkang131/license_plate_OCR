# License Plate Recognition using OCR (Optical Character Recognition)

Author : [Darren Kang Wan Chee](https://www.linkedin.com/in/darren-kang-wan-chee/)

This project aims to recognize the character of a certain license plate using EasyOCR and Tesseract OCR

The Tesseract OCR is done with both Non-Sharpened Images and Sharpened Images

The EasyOCR is done with Binarazation and Denoised Images

## Project Summary
### Tesseract with Non-Sharpened Images
Tesseract Accuracy: 0.008

Run Time: 49m 17.6s
### Tesseract with Sharpened Images
Tesseract Accuracy: 0.00165

Run Time: 48m 24.2s
### EasyOCR with Binarization and Denoised Images
OCR Accuracy: 0.05295

Run Time: 67m 21.3s

The result of this project is far from perfect because of the accuracy is very low.

Please feel free to discuss with me through [email](darrenkang03@gmail.com) if you know how to improve the quality of the OCR
